# ✅ Breakpoints Are Ready to Test!

## What Was Fixed

The `/api/test-debug` endpoint was being blocked by authentication middleware. This has been fixed by adding it to the `AUTH_EXCLUDED_ROUTES` list in `middleware.ts`.

## Test Now!

The endpoint is now working and ready for debugging tests:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost:3000/api/test-debug
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "message": "If you see this in the debugger, debugging works!",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-10T..."
}
```

## Next Steps to Test Breakpoints

### Step 1: Start the Debugger
1. Open Debug panel in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+D)
2. Select **"Next.js: debug server-side"**
3. Press **F5**
4. Wait for "Ready in X.Xs" message

### Step 2: Compile the Route (First Request)
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost:3000/api/test-debug
```

This compiles the route and generates source maps.

### Step 3: Set Breakpoints
1. Open `app/api/test-debug/route.ts`
2. Click in the gutter (left of line numbers) on line 4 or 5
3. You should see a **red dot** (not a gray circle)

### Step 4: Test Breakpoints (Second Request)
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost:3000/api/test-debug
```

**Expected:** Execution should pause at your breakpoint!

## Automated Testing

Or just run the automated test script:

```powershell
.\test-breakpoints.ps1
```

This will:
- ✅ Check if server is running
- ✅ Check if debugger is attached
- ✅ Compile the route
- ✅ Prompt you to set breakpoints
- ✅ Test if breakpoints hit

## If Breakpoints Still Don't Hit

### Quick Fix 1: Use debugger; Statement

Open `app/api/test-debug/route.ts` and the `debugger;` statement is already there on line 3:

```typescript
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  debugger; // Test if debugger statement works
  
  const testData = {
    message: "If you see this in the debugger, debugging works!",
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  };
  
  console.log("Test debug endpoint hit");
  
  return NextResponse.json(testData);
}
```

When you make a request, execution **will pause** at line 3 if the debugger is properly attached.

### Quick Fix 2: Try Attach Mode

If the "launch" configuration doesn't work:

1. Start server normally: `npm run dev:debug`
2. In Debug panel, select **"Next.js: attach"**
3. Press F5
4. Follow steps 2-4 above

### Quick Fix 3: Disable Auto-Attach

1. Press Ctrl+Shift+P
2. Type: "Debug: Toggle Auto Attach"
3. Select: **"Disabled"**
4. Restart VS Code
5. Try again

## Verify Debugger is Working

### Check 1: Terminal Output
Look for this message in the terminal:
```
Debugger attached.
```

### Check 2: Debug Port
```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 9229 -State Listen
```

Should show a connection on port 9229.

### Check 3: VS Code Debug Toolbar
When debugger is attached, you should see the debug toolbar at the top of VS Code with play/pause/stop buttons.

## For Your propset_ex Route

Once breakpoints are working for the test endpoint, you can use them in your `propset_ex` route:

1. Make a request from Be Informed (compiles the route)
2. Set breakpoints in `app/api/svn/propset_ex/route.ts`
3. Make another request
4. Breakpoints should hit!

**Or use the comprehensive logging:**
- View at: http://localhost:3000/logs
- Shows complete request body from Be Informed
- Shows all replacements being processed
- Real-time updates

## Summary

✅ **Fixed:** Test endpoint now accessible without authentication
✅ **Ready:** Debugger configuration is set up
✅ **Next:** Start debugger (F5) and test breakpoints

**Run this to test everything:**
```powershell
.\test-breakpoints.ps1
```
